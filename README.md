# WE ADVISE UTA ADVISING SYSTEM

## VISION

WeAdvise is a web app in which facilitates either an advisor or a student regarding their academic advising. Currently, there is not any web application available which help students get their advising online. WeAdvise offers students to Get in line, Online through the website. Students have to wait in queue for an hour just to get themselves advised, Students does not know how long they have to wait to meet their advisors, Advisors are unaware about how many students are in the advising list. These are some of the things that are missing in the present advising process. WeAdvise is the solution for such problems that students and advisors are facing. WeAdvise makes student easier to meet the advisor of their preference in time efficient way. The main vision of WeAdvise is to overcome long waiting time to meet an advisor from anywhere using any kind of browser.

## MISSION

"UTA Advising" project has the mission to accomplish the above vision making easier for advisors and students. So, we are going to build the web application. The web will have the names of advisors with their time table of advising. Students have to register themselves with valid UTA email and student ID. The student will have their account where they will put their courses taken in the chart and could also add those courses they want to take in the coming semesters. So, the advisors will look at the chart of taken courses and required courses making easier for both as it will also validate the meet of prerequisites. It will also track the progress of the degree.


#### `DEPARTMENT OF COMPUTER SCIENCE & ENGINEERING THE UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT ARLINGTON`




This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
