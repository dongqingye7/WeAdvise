## VISION

WeAdvise is a web app in which facilitates either an advisor or a student regarding their academic advising. Currently, there is not any web application available which help students get their advising online. WeAdvise offers students to Get in line, Online through the website. Students have to wait in queue for an hour just to get themselves advised, Students does not know how long they have to wait to meet their advisors, Advisors are unaware about how many students are in the advising list. These are some of the things that are missing in the present advising process. WeAdvise is the solution for such problems that students and advisors are facing. WeAdvise makes student easier to meet the advisor of their preference in time efficient way. The main vision of WeAdvise is to overcome long waiting time to meet an advisor from anywhere using any kind of browser.

## MISSION

"UTA Advising" project has the mission to accomplish the above vision making easier for advisors and students. So, we are going to build the web application. The web will have the names of advisors with their time table of advising. Students have to register themselves with valid UTA email and student ID. The student will have their account where they will put their courses taken in the chart and could also add those courses they want to take in the coming semesters. So, the advisors will look at the chart of taken courses and required courses making easier for both as it will also validate the meet of prerequisites. It will also track the progress of the degree.
